  1. I have learned that sometimes there are more than one tag that produces the same result. However, they have different meanings. I could mention the tags "<i>" and "<em>", "<b>" and "<strong"> and "<strike>" and "<del>".
  2. The exercise itself was easy because it came with the texts already written and in the place that they should be.
  3. There wasn't any very difficult thing to do.
  4. Instead of using the tags that I already know, I tried to search if there was one that produces the same result but has a better meaning for that part of code. For instance, instead of using "strike" I found "del" would fit better in the context
